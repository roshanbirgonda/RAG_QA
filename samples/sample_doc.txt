The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system.

The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested. The textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods.

The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and many of the technological innovations were of British origin. By the mid-18th century Britain was the world's leading commercial nation, controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean, and with major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent, particularly with the proto-industrialization of the Bengal region. The development of trade and the rise of business were major causes of the Industrial Revolution.

Technological developments in Britain led to significant changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation and technology. The introduction of steam power and powered machinery (most notably in textile manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries.

The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world. The impact of this change on society was enormous. The first Industrial Revolution, which began in the 18th century, merged into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships, railways, and later in the 19th century with the internal combustion engine and electrical power generation.

The Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the most important effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history. Others argue that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.

Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centers in Belgium, Germany, and later in France and the northeastern United States. Key technologies such as the spinning jenny, water frame, and power loom revolutionized textile production.

In transportation, the development of the steam engine led to the creation of steamboats and the expansion of railways, which reduced travel time and expanded markets for goods. The iron and steel industries grew rapidly, supported by new techniques like the Bessemer process. Improvements in precision tools, such as the lathe and milling machine, enabled more complex and standardized parts to be made.

The social impact of the Industrial Revolution was equally significant. Urbanization increased as people moved to cities in search of factory jobs. Living conditions were often poor, with overcrowded housing and inadequate sanitation. Labor movements began to emerge in response to working conditions, laying the foundation for modern labor laws and unions.

The Industrial Revolution was not without its critics. Writers and intellectuals of the time debated its effects on human well-being, nature, and society. Some viewed it as progress, while others saw the loss of craftsmanship, environmental degradation, and worker exploitation as major problems that needed to be addressed.

In conclusion, the Industrial Revolution was a complex, transformative era that reshaped the economic, social, and technological landscape of the world. Its legacy continues to influence modern industry, urban development, and economic thought.
